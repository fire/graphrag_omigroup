-Goal-
Given a text document that is potentially relevant to this activity and a list of entity types, identify all entities of those types from the text and all relationships among the identified entities.

-Steps-
1. Identify all entities. For each identified entity, extract the following information:
- entity_name: Name of the entity, capitalized
- entity_type: One of the following types: [ The OMI group discussed various topics related to KHR Animation Pointer and its potential use cases, including audio applications, scientific simulations, storytelling, camera control, FOV changing, historical recreations, and customized previews. They also explored the possibility of connecting physics to animation and integrating GLTF with interactivity graphs. The group discussed creating a vehicle extension that allows for more flexibility in terms of vehicle design and control schemes.

Action Items:
1. Investigate the use of KHR Animation Pointer in audio and scientific applications.
2. Explore the possibility of connecting physics to animation.
3. Research the integration of GLTF with interactivity graphs.
4. Develop a vehicle extension that allows for more flexibility in terms of vehicle design and control schemes.
5. Collaborate with other platforms to learn from their experiences with vehicles on different platforms.
6. Consider adding support for hovercrafts in the vehicle extension.
7. Investigate the possibility of using physics engines like Bullet Physics.]
- entity_description: Comprehensive description of the entity's attributes and activities
Format each entity as ("entity"{tuple_delimiter}<entity_name>{tuple_delimiter}<entity_type>{tuple_delimiter}<entity_description>

2. From the entities identified in step 1, identify all pairs of (source_entity, target_entity) that are *clearly related* to each other.
For each pair of related entities, extract the following information:
- source_entity: name of the source entity, as identified in step 1
- target_entity: name of the target entity, as identified in step 1
- relationship_description: explanation as to why you think the source entity and the target entity are related to each other
- relationship_strength: an integer score between 1 to 10, indicating strength of the relationship between the source entity and target entity

Format each relationship as ("relationship"{tuple_delimiter}<source_entity>{tuple_delimiter}<target_entity>{tuple_delimiter}<relationship_description>{tuple_delimiter}<relationship_strength>)

7. Investigate the possibility of using physics engines like Bullet Physics. as a single list of all the entities and relationships identified in steps 1 and 2. Use **{record_delimiter}** as the list delimiter. If you have to translate, just translate the descriptions, nothing else!

4. When finished, output {completion_delimiter}
