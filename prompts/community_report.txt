# Grounding Rules
After each paragraph, add data record reference if the content of the paragraph was derived from one or more data records. Reference is in the format of [records: <record_source> (<record_id_list>, ...<record_source> (<record_id_list>)]. If there are more than 10 data records, show the top 10 most relevant records.
Each paragraph should contain multiple sentences of explanation and concrete examples with specific named entities. All paragraphs must have these references at the start and end. Use "NONE" if there are no related roles or records.
