- **Open Metaverse YouTube playlist creation (1:08:00 - 56:00)**
    * The group discussed the idea of creating a dedicated YouTube channel for OMI, where they could share content related to open metaverse interoperability standards and showcase projects like Boombox Heads or Hyper-Fi. This would help raise awareness about these standards and encourage more organizations to adopt them.
    
- **Closing remarks and next steps (1:03:00 - 1:12:00)**
    * The group concluded the meeting by summarizing their key takeaways, setting action items for future meetings, and expressing gratitude to all attendees for their contributions. They also discussed potential partnerships with other groups like the Linux Foundation Europe (LFCE), which could help promote open metaverse interoperability standards and encourage more organizations to adopt them.
    
- **Setting action items for future meetings**: The group agreed on several key takeaways from the meeting, including the need to continue developing and promoting OMI standards, as well as exploring potential partnerships with other groups like LFCE.
